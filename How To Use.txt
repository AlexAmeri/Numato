Welcome to the 2020 Embedded 2 Virtual Lab!

In order to "virtually" press buttons and throw switches on our lab Zybo boards,
please do the following:


1. Navigate to the python/ directory in this project folder
2. Open a terminal, and type:
	sh virtual_buttons_and_switches.sh
   
   This will install some python libraries needed for the utility.

3. Pressing keys 1 through 4 will drive some of the Zybo board pins active high for
   100 milliseconds. Pressing keys 5 through 8 will toggle some other pins active high or
   low.
